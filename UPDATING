For the most part, the "build.sh" scripts speak for themselves. When adding a framework, jpeg is a good standard script to start from.

The most obvious change is to the "unpack source" section in build.sh. You may also need to update CONFIGOPTS, or FWKS if new dynamic libraries are added.

If frameworks depend on one another, care is needed to get the links right. See the ffmpeg build file for examples. Use "otool -L" to check your work.

If multiple frameworks are produced by one package, it can also be tricky to get the headers correct. See vorbis and png for ways to handle unusual cases.
